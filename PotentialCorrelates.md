    - Hyperphosphatemia

    - Kidney Failure
        - Impaired kidney function in which the kidneys fail to adequately filter metabolic wastes from the blood.
        - https://medlineplus.gov/kidneyfailure.html
        - [ref][LeveyCKD]
            - Kidney failure is traditionally regarded as the most serious outcome of chronic kidney disease and symptoms are usually caused by complications of reduced kidney function. When symptoms are severe they can be treated only by dialysis and transplantation; kidney failure treated this way is known as end-stage renal disease. Kidney failure is defined as a GFR of less than 15 mL/min per 1·73 m2, or the need for treatment with dialysis or transplantation.

    - Dialysis
    - Renal Transplant
    - ACE inhibitors
        - [ref][MetcalfeProgression] The kidneys also generate angiotensin II locally, independent of the systemic system, and acting via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor this has significant non-haemodynamic effects contributing to the development of tubulo-interstitial fibrosis by stimulating expression of cytokines and growth factors favouring fibrosis and recruitment of macrophages [26]. Thus, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors performs a dual role, both lowering the glomerular capillary pressure and preventing the increase in pro-fibrotic cytokine expression.
        - ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and limit the progression of deterioration of CKD both by reducing glomerular capillary hypertension and by reducing the mean dimensions of large unselective pores of the glomerular capillary wall so enhancing the size-selective function of this barrier to macromolecules.
    - [ref][AbbateProgression]
        - The renoprotection that was conferred by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the REIN study was mediated by the drug’s action of reducing urinary protein levels, to the extent that patients who were on ramipril had a better outcome paralleled by more reduction in proteinuria, whereas BP was comparable to that of control subjects (3). ACE inhibitor–induced reduction in proteinuria was the strongest time-dependent covariate predicting slower progression to ESRD.






Likely Or Proven Correlates:

- Acidaemia
    - CKD causes this
    - In renal failure the kidneys are unable to excrete the normal acid waste products of the body. People in renal failure often have too much acid in the blood (acidaemia) and have to take bicarbonate tablets to neutralise this.
- Infective, obstructive and reflux nephropathies
- Hyperglycemia
- Erythropoietin
- Hyperkalemia
- Uraemia
- Myeloma
- Renal papillary necrosis
- Pericarditis
    - CKD causes this?
    - This causes angina
- Cardiovascular Disease
    - CKD causes this
    - Heart attack, stroke or Cerebrovascular Accident, (congestive) heart failure, ischemic heart disease, COPD (is this CVD?), Peripheral Arterial Disease, Peripheral vascular diseases, Transient Ischaemic Attack, coronary heart disease ("Coronary Artery Disease", "Ischemic Heart Disease"), etc. etc.
    - Risk factors for CVD like: smoking status; lipid management; proteinuria; anaemia; glycated haemoglobin and microalbuminuria in people with diabetes; serum cholesterol and total cholesterol: HDL ratio; BMI, alcohol consumption; urinalysis and total protein creatinine ratio; haemoglobin concentration


- Signs and Symptoms
    - Hypoxia
    - Blood pressure is increased due to fluid overload and production of vasoactive hormones created by the kidney via the renin-angiotensin system, increasing one's risk of developing hypertension and/or suffering from congestive heart failure.
    - Urea accumulates, leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic circulation, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates ("uremic frost").
    - Potassium accumulates in the blood (hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias). Hyperkalemia usually does not develop until the glomerular filtration rate falls to less than 20-25 ml/min/1.73 m2, at which point the kidneys have decreased ability to excrete potassium. Hyperkalemia in CKD can be exacerbated by acidemia (which leads to extracellular shift of potassium) and from lack of insulin.[8]
    - Erythropoietin synthesis is decreased causing anemia.
    - Fluid volume overload symptoms may range from mild edema to life-threatening pulmonary edema.
    - Hyperphosphatemia, due to reduced phosphate excretion, follows the decrease in glomerular filtration. Hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, being a direct stimulus to vascular calcification.[9] Moreover, circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) increase progressively as the renal capacity for phosphate excretion declines, but this adaptative response may also contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased mortality in CKD patients.[10][11]
    - Hypocalcemia, due to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 deficiency (caused by stimulation of FGF-23 and reduction of renal mass),[12] and resistance to the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone.[13] Osteocytes are responsible for the increased production of FGF-23, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3).[14] Later, this progresses to secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function. An extreme consequence is the occurrence of the rare condition named calciphylaxis.[15]
    - Metabolic acidosis (due to accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, uric acid etc.) may cause altered enzyme activity by excess acid acting on enzymes; and also increased excitability of cardiac and neuronal membranes by the promotion of hyperkalemia due to excess acid (acidemia).[17] Acidosis is also due to decreased capacity to generate enough ammonia from the cells of the proximal tubule.[8]
    - Relative Erythropoietin Deficiency
    - Iron deficiency anemia, which increases in prevalence as kidney function decreases, is especially prevalent in those requiring haemodialysis. It is multifactoral in cause, but includes increased inflammation, reduction in erythropoietin, and hyperuricemia leading to bone marrow suppression.
    - Gout
        - Gout may occur in otherwise healthy people. However, patients with CKD suffer gout more commonly because they often have high levels of uric acid (or urate) in their blood. This is mainly because their kidneys are less effective at removing uric acid from their blood. Patients with CKD may also take medicines (such as water tablets or diuretics) or have other medical conditions (such as high blood pressure) that lead to higher levels of uric acid. The uric acid forms crystals within the patient’s joints. These crystals lead to inflammation and the affected joint becomes hot, red and swollen. Gout can be extremely painful. Any joint may be affected but the big toe is the most common site.
        - Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Brufen®, Abbott, UK) or diclofenac (Voltarol®, Novartis, UK) are the most common treatment for gout in patients without kidney disease, they should be avoided in patients with CKD. A tablet called colchicine is often used instead. This is a very effective treatment for gout, but some patients find that it causes diarrhoea, in which case it should be stopped. If possible, colchicine tablets should be taken at the very beginning of an attack. A short course of steroids (such as prednisolone tablets) may also be used.
        - Dietitians can help patients reduce the amount of uric acid they ingest in their food. Patients with gout should reduce their consumption of beer, wine, yeasts (for example, Marmite®), red meats (especially liver) and certain fish (particularly anchovies, herring and mackerel). The drugs used to treat acute attacks of gout will not help to prevent further episodes. If the attacks become frequent, medications to lower the levels of uric acid in the blood might be considered; the most common of which is called allopurinol

Treatments

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
    - ACE inhibitors cause relaxation of blood vessels, as well as a decreased blood volume, which leads to lower blood pressure and decreased oxygen demand from the heart. They inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme, an important component of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.
