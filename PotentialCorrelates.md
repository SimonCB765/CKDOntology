    - Hyperphosphatemia

    - Kidney Failure
        - Impaired kidney function in which the kidneys fail to adequately filter metabolic wastes from the blood.
        - https://medlineplus.gov/kidneyfailure.html
        - [ref][LeveyCKD]
            - Kidney failure is traditionally regarded as the most serious outcome of chronic kidney disease and symptoms are usually caused by complications of reduced kidney function. When symptoms are severe they can be treated only by dialysis and transplantation; kidney failure treated this way is known as end-stage renal disease. Kidney failure is defined as a GFR of less than 15 mL/min per 1·73 m2, or the need for treatment with dialysis or transplantation.

    - Dialysis
    - Renal Transplant
    - ACE inhibitors
        - [ref][MetcalfeProgression] The kidneys also generate angiotensin II locally, independent of the systemic system, and acting via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor this has significant non-haemodynamic effects contributing to the development of tubulo-interstitial fibrosis by stimulating expression of cytokines and growth factors favouring fibrosis and recruitment of macrophages [26]. Thus, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors performs a dual role, both lowering the glomerular capillary pressure and preventing the increase in pro-fibrotic cytokine expression.
        - ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and limit the progression of deterioration of CKD both by reducing glomerular capillary hypertension and by reducing the mean dimensions of large unselective pores of the glomerular capillary wall so enhancing the size-selective function of this barrier to macromolecules.
    - [ref][AbbateProgression]
        - The renoprotection that was conferred by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the REIN study was mediated by the drug’s action of reducing urinary protein levels, to the extent that patients who were on ramipril had a better outcome paralleled by more reduction in proteinuria, whereas BP was comparable to that of control subjects (3). ACE inhibitor–induced reduction in proteinuria was the strongest time-dependent covariate predicting slower progression to ESRD.






Likely Or Proven Correlates:

- Acidaemia
    - CKD causes this
    - In renal failure the kidneys are unable to excrete the normal acid waste products of the body. People in renal failure often have too much acid in the blood (acidaemia) and have to take bicarbonate tablets to neutralise this.
- Infective, obstructive and reflux nephropathies
- Hyperglycemia
- Erythropoietin
- Hyperkalemia
- Uraemia
- Myeloma
- Renal papillary necrosis
- Pericarditis
    - CKD causes this?
    - This causes angina
- Cardiovascular Disease
    - CKD causes this
    - Heart attack, stroke or Cerebrovascular Accident, (congestive) heart failure, ischemic heart disease, COPD (is this CVD?), Peripheral Arterial Disease, Peripheral vascular diseases, Transient Ischaemic Attack, coronary heart disease ("Coronary Artery Disease", "Ischemic Heart Disease"), etc. etc.
    - Risk factors for CVD like: smoking status; lipid management; proteinuria; anaemia; glycated haemoglobin and microalbuminuria in people with diabetes; serum cholesterol and total cholesterol: HDL ratio; BMI, alcohol consumption; urinalysis and total protein creatinine ratio; haemoglobin concentration


- Signs and Symptoms
    - Hypoxia
    - Blood pressure is increased due to fluid overload and production of vasoactive hormones created by the kidney via the renin-angiotensin system, increasing one's risk of developing hypertension and/or suffering from congestive heart failure.
    - Urea accumulates, leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic circulation, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates ("uremic frost").
    - Potassium accumulates in the blood (hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias). Hyperkalemia usually does not develop until the glomerular filtration rate falls to less than 20-25 ml/min/1.73 m2, at which point the kidneys have decreased ability to excrete potassium. Hyperkalemia in CKD can be exacerbated by acidemia (which leads to extracellular shift of potassium) and from lack of insulin.[8]
    - Hypocalcemia, due to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 deficiency (caused by stimulation of FGF-23 and reduction of renal mass),[12] and resistance to the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone.[13] Osteocytes are responsible for the increased production of FGF-23, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3).[14] Later, this progresses to secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function. An extreme consequence is the occurrence of the rare condition named calciphylaxis.[15]


Other Correlates - No literature checks have been performed to see how these hold up as real causes

- Folate (B12) Deficiency
- Impaired Glucose Tolerance
- Angina - chest pain due to restricted blood flow
- Balkan (endemic) Nephropathy (ReadV2 K0B6.)
- Dehydration

Treatments

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
    - ACE inhibitors cause relaxation of blood vessels, as well as a decreased blood volume, which leads to lower blood pressure and decreased oxygen demand from the heart. They inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme, an important component of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.
