            - Statins - Most of the studies have used statins directed at lowering cholesterol,239 although some work has also been published on the use of triglyceride-lowering agents.240 Apart from their lipid-lowering effects, statins also have other actions that may ameliorate the progression of chronic renal failure. Statins down-regulate TGF-β expression,241 interfere with intracellular signaling pathways,241 and prevent the activation of nuclear factor κB and substances downstream of TGF-β such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and connective tissue growth factor. Statins also possess antioxidant activity242 and some antihypertensive effect.243 A recent meta-analysis of trials that were mostly based on statins showed a modest benefit in slowing down GFR decline.239
- Hyperparathyroid Bone Disease
- Hyperparathyroidism (Secondary)
    - Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) and associated hyperplasia of the glands.
- Hyperphosphatemia
- Hypertension
- Hypocalcemia
- Hypovitaminosis D
- Metastatic Calcification
- Osteomalacia
- Poteinuria
- Renal Osteodystrophy

Find information about the following measures:

- Calcium (plasma, serum, ionised serum level, etc.)
- Parathyroid Hormone (serum)
- Vitamin D (serum)
    - If calcitrol level only is measured, rather than both it and calcidiol, then you're really only measuring calcitrol level without any idea of how much calcidiol you're body is producing
        - Realy want vitamin D level (calcidiol) and activated (calcitrol)
- (Inorganic) phosphate/phosphorus (blood, plasma, serum, etc.)

Find information about the following treatments:

- Calcimimetrics
- Calcium Supplement
- Dialysis
- Parathyroidectomy
- Phosphate Binders
- Renal Transplant
- Vitamin D Replacement Therapy

I believe that hyperparathyroid bone disease is essentially high turnover or high formation bone disease as the high PTH level increases osteoclast and osteoblast activity
Adynamic usualy results as a consequence of taking medications to treat hyperparathyroid bone disease
