            - Statins - Most of the studies have used statins directed at lowering cholesterol,239 although some work has also been published on the use of triglyceride-lowering agents.240 Apart from their lipid-lowering effects, statins also have other actions that may ameliorate the progression of chronic renal failure. Statins down-regulate TGF-β expression,241 interfere with intracellular signaling pathways,241 and prevent the activation of nuclear factor κB and substances downstream of TGF-β such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and connective tissue growth factor. Statins also possess antioxidant activity242 and some antihypertensive effect.243 A recent meta-analysis of trials that were mostly based on statins showed a modest benefit in slowing down GFR decline.239
- (Hyper)lipiduria
- Hyperparathyroid Bone Disease
- Hyperparathyroidism (Secondary)
    - Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) and associated hyperplasia of the glands.
- Hyperphosphatemia
- Hypertension
- Hypervolemia
- Hypoalbuminemia
- Hypocalcemia
- Hyponatremia
    - Hypervolemic Hyponatremia
        - Two of the major etiologies of hypervolemic hyponatremia are heart failure (HF) and cirrhosis
        - Can potentially result in hypokalemia due to the increased sodium retention.
- Hypoproteinemia
- Hypovitaminosis D
- IgA Nephropathy
- Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis
- Membranous Glomerulonephritis (Membranous Nephropathy)
- Mesangial Proliferative Glomerulonephritis (Mesangiocapillary Glomerulonephritis)
- Metabolic Acidosis
- Metastatic Calcification
- Minimal Change Disease
- Nephritic Syndrome
- Nephrotic Syndrome
- Oliguria
- Osteomalacia
- Pleural Effusion
- Postinfectious Glomerulonephritis
- Poteinuria
- Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis
- Renal Osteodystrophy
- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus Nephritis)
- Thin Basement Membrane Disease
- Thrombophilia
- Uremia
- Vasculitis

Find information about the following diagnostics:

- Albumin
- Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
- Calcium (plasma, serum, ionised serum level, etc.)
- Creatinine
- Lipid Panel (Lipid Profile)
- Parathyroid Hormone (serum)
- Phosphate/Phosphorus (blood, plasma, serum, etc.)
- Potassium Level
- Protein:Creatinine Ratio (PCR)
- Red Blood Cell Casts
- Renal Biopsy
- Urine Protein
    - Urine Dipstick
    - 24 Hour Urine Collection
- Urine Volume
- Vitamin D (serum)
    - If calcitrol level only is measured, rather than both it and calcidiol, then you're really only measuring calcitrol level without any idea of how much calcidiol you're body is producing
        - Realy want vitamin D level (calcidiol) and activated (calcitrol)

I believe that hyperparathyroid bone disease is essentially high turnover or high formation bone disease as the high PTH level increases osteoclast and osteoblast activity
Adynamic usualy results as a consequence of taking medications to treat hyperparathyroid bone disease
