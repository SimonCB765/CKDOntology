    - Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis)
    - Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis
    - Glomerulonephritis
        - Definitely leads to CKD - (a family of different forms of kidney inflammation) can lead to CKD. These conditions affect the glomeruli, the fine filters in our kidneys. At one time, these diseases were collectively known as Bright’s Disease – before modern research identified them as separate conditions.
- Hyperlipidemia
    - Treatments
        - [ref][YuProgression]
            - Statins - Most of the studies have used statins directed at lowering cholesterol,239 although some work has also been published on the use of triglyceride-lowering agents.240 Apart from their lipid-lowering effects, statins also have other actions that may ameliorate the progression of chronic renal failure. Statins down-regulate TGF-β expression,241 interfere with intracellular signaling pathways,241 and prevent the activation of nuclear factor κB and substances downstream of TGF-β such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and connective tissue growth factor. Statins also possess antioxidant activity242 and some antihypertensive effect.243 A recent meta-analysis of trials that were mostly based on statins showed a modest benefit in slowing down GFR decline.239
- Hyperparathyroid Bone Disease
- Hyperparathyroidism (Secondary)
    - Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) and associated hyperplasia of the glands.
- Hyperphosphatemia
- Hypertension
    - Treatments
        - [ref][YuProgression]
            - The renal benefit of treatment depends to a significant extent on the underlying proteinuria. This was borne out in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study, which consisted of 2 randomized clinical trials. Study 1 evaluated patients with GFRs of 25 to 55 mL/min, while study 2 evaluated patients with GFRs of 13 to 24 mL/min. In both studies, patients were randomized to groups with mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals of either 92 mm Hg or 107 mm Hg. The decline in GFR was found to be slower in the more aggressively treated group overall, and the benefit was in direct proportion to the severity of the baseline proteinuria.190
            - In renal disease from type 1 diabetes mellitus, tighter blood pressure control, independent of use of ACE inhibitors, decreases proteinuria.191 A recent study from the Steno Diabetes Center showed that tight blood pressure control (MAP goal of 93 mm Hg) in this population can decrease the GFR decline to that found with normal aging.192
            - Thus, to slow down GFR decline, the goal for patients without diabetes with significant proteinuria involving at least 1 g/d and for patients with diabetes is to lower the MAP to the low 90s. Based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study data, Peterson and coworkers195 have suggested a MAP goal of 98 mm Hg or lower for patients with proteinuria involving between 0.25 and 1 g/d.

            - ACE Inhibitors
                - As many of the pathophysiologic changes associated with chronic renal disease are driven by AII, ACE inhibitors have become the logical and accepted choice for treatment. ACE inhibitors block the rate-limiting step in the formation of AII. Benefits have been shown in experimental and clinical settings. These drugs preferentially dilate the efferent arteriole, thereby hemodynamically decreasing glomerular hypertension and proteinuria.196,197 They also decrease proteinuria by preserving the integrity of component proteins of the slit diaphragm198,199 and by ameliorating podocyte foot process broadening.200
                - Clinical benefits have been found for diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease.67,205- 207 In patients with diabetes, ACE inhibitors prevent progression of microalbuminuria, even in patients with controlled blood pressure. In a European study on type 1 diabetes mellitus, mean baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the group randomized to receive lisinopril were 122 and 79 mm Hg, respectively. Adjustment for effects of systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduced, but did not eliminate, this benefit.206 A meta-analysis of 12 studies involving type 1 diabetes mellitus also came to the same conclusion.208
                - Even in the presence of chronic renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitors can be used.207,209,210 The benefits are proportional to the extent of proteinuria.67,210 Improvement in proteinuria is evident within the first 2 months.67,211 The preservation of GFR is directly proportional to the extent of lowering of proteinuria, which thus serves as a useful prognostic indicator.67,212
            - Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
                - Because ACE can be formed by non–ACE-dependent pathways and because of intolerance to ACE inhibitors in many patients, ARBs have been increasingly used to delay progression of renal damage. Experimentally, ARBs have been shown to block fibroblast proliferation and synthesis of TGF-β.201 As in the case of ACE inhibitors, multiple mechanisms are responsible for the antiproteinuric effect.
                - Recent clinical trials have shown that these agents diminish proteinuria215- 217 and protect against renal function decline among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy.215,216 The 2 largest studies have been done on patients with relatively mild azotemia. However, results from studies using ACE inhibitors suggest that ARBs may be beneficial even in patients with more advanced chronic renal failure.
            - Calcium-Channel Blockers
                - Dihydropyridines do not have antiproteinuric effects.210,225 Nondihydropyridines, in contrast, appear to have some role, at least in diabetic nephropathy.226,227 There are no good data on its usage in nondiabetic nephropathies for retarding progression of renal disease, although plans for a multicenter study were recently published to investigate combined treatment with an ACE inhibitor and either a dihydropyridine or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, using proteinuria as an end point.228
            - β-Blockers
                - Though smaller studies had suggested that β-blockers may worsen the decline of GFR in patients with diabetes,227,229 the larger UKPDS-39 study found atenolol and captopril to be equivalent in limiting progression of albuminuria and azotemia over 4 years.230 Interestingly, a recent animal study found that blocking the sympathetic nervous system may be beneficial independent of antihypertensive effects.231 In a multicenter prospective study of nondiabetic African Americans with hypertensive renal disease, metoprolol was comparable with ramipril in reduction of proteinuria and in progression to end-stage renal disease.232 However, a composite end point and the overall rate of GFR decline was worse with metoprolol, suggesting that ACE inhibitors should still be the preferred agents in this population.
- Renal Osteodystrophy

- Calcium (plasma, serum, ionised serum level, etc.)
- Parathyroid Hormone (serum)
- Vitamin D (serum)
    - If calcitrol level only is measured, rather than both it and calcidiol, then you're really only measuring calcitrol level without any idea of how much calcidiol you're body is producing
        - Realy want vitamin D level (calcidiol) and activated (calcitrol)
- (Inorganic) phosphate/phosphorus (blood, plasma, serum, etc.)

I believe that hyperparathyroid bone disease is essentially high turnover or high formation bone disease as the high PTH level increases osteoclast and osteoblast activity
Adynamic usualy results as a consequence of taking medications to treat hyperparathyroid bone disease
- Bone Pain
    - Caused by some aspect of Renal Osteodystrophy (or many aspects)
- Bone Fracture
    - Caused by some aspect of Renal Osteodystrophy (or many aspects)

Likely Or Proven Correlates:

- Alport Syndrome
- Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome
- Nephrosclerosis
    - Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis
- Nephrosis/Nephrotic Syndrome
    - This may be a consequence of CKD or some of its correlates, but it seems unlikely to be a cause
    - http://www.pathophys.org/nephrotic/
- Anemia
    - https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/health-information/anaemia-and-kidney-disease
    - The anaemia that goes with renal failure is mainly due to a deficiency of a hormone called erythropoietin (Epo). Epo is produced by the kidney to stimulate red blood cell production from the bone marrow. A deficiency of Epo leads to anaemia.
    - Often the anaemia of renal failure can be helped by taking iron. Some people remain short of iron even when taking iron tablets. If so, you might need a course of intravenous iron injections. This is usually done at the hospital as an out patient.
    - With more severe anaemia you may be prescribed Epo, which has to be given as injections, usually once or twice a week. You can learn to give this to yourself quite easily.
- Acidaemia
    - CKD causes this
    - In renal failure the kidneys are unable to excrete the normal acid waste products of the body. People in renal failure often have too much acid in the blood (acidaemia) and have to take bicarbonate tablets to neutralise this.
- Infective, obstructive and reflux nephropathies
- Hyperglycemia
- Erythropoietin
- Hyperkalemia
- Arteriopathic renal disease
- Uraemia
- Myeloma
- Renal papillary necrosis
