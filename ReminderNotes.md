Next find measures, treatments, symptoms and consequences for the following conditions (esp as they relate to CVD):

- Adynamic Bone Disease
- Arteriosclerosis
- Calciphylaxis
- Diabetes
    - T1DM
    - T2DM
    - Diabetic Retinopathy
- Extraskeletal Calcification
- Glomerular Disease

    - http://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-disease-overview-beyond-the-basics
    - Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis)
    - Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis
    - Glomerulonephritis
        - Definitely leads to CKD - (a family of different forms of kidney inflammation) can lead to CKD. These conditions affect the glomeruli, the fine filters in our kidneys. At one time, these diseases were collectively known as Bright’s Disease – before modern research identified them as separate conditions.
- Hyperparathyroid Bone Disease
- Hyperparathyroidism (Secondary)
    - Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) and associated hyperplasia of the glands.
- Hyperphosphatemia
- Hypertension
- Hypocalcemia
- Hypovitaminosis D
- Metastatic Calcification
- Osteomalacia
- Renal Osteodystrophy

Find information about the following measures:

- Calcium (plasma, serum, ionised serum level, etc.)
- Parathyroid Hormone (serum)
- Vitamin D (serum)
    - If calcitrol level only is measured, rather than both it and calcidiol, then you're really only measuring calcitrol level without any idea of how much calcidiol you're body is producing
        - Realy want vitamin D level (calcidiol) and activated (calcitrol)
- (Inorganic) phosphate/phosphorus (blood, plasma, serum, etc.)

Find information about the following treatments:

- Calcimimetrics
- Calcium Supplement
- Dialysis
- Parathyroidectomy
- Phosphate Binders
- Renal Transplant
- Vitamin D Replacement Therapy

I believe that hyperparathyroid bone disease is essentially high turnover or high formation bone disease as the high PTH level increases osteoclast and osteoblast activity
Adynamic usualy results as a consequence of taking medications to treat hyperparathyroid bone disease
- Bone Pain
    - Caused by some aspect of Renal Osteodystrophy (or many aspects)
- Bone Fracture
    - Caused by some aspect of Renal Osteodystrophy (or many aspects)
- Bone Deformation
    - Caused by some aspect of Renal Osteodystrophy (or many aspects)
- Joint Pain
    - Caused by some aspect of Renal Osteodystrophy (or many aspects)


Likely Or Proven Correlates:

    - This may be a consequence of CKD or some of its correlates, but it seems unlikely to be a cause
    - http://www.pathophys.org/nephrotic/

    - CKD causes this
    - https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/health-information/anaemia-and-kidney-disease
- Infective, obstructive and reflux nephropathies
- Arteriopathic renal disease
- Neoplasms

    - CKD causes this?
    - This causes angina
- Cardiovascular Disease
    - CKD causes this
    - Heart attack, stroke or Cerebrovascular Accident, (congestive) heart failure, ischemic heart disease, COPD (is this CVD?), Peripheral Arterial Disease, Peripheral vascular diseases, Transient Ischaemic Attack, coronary heart disease ("Coronary Artery Disease", "Ischemic Heart Disease"), etc. etc.
    - Risk factors for CVD like: smoking status; lipid management; proteinuria; anaemia; glycated haemoglobin and microalbuminuria in people with diabetes; serum cholesterol and total cholesterol: HDL ratio; BMI, alcohol consumption; urinalysis and total protein creatinine ratio; haemoglobin concentration




Other Correlates - No literature checks have been performed to see how these hold up as real causes

- inflammation
- Hematuria
- Hyperglycemia

    - Pneumonia
    - Sepsis
    - Pulmonary infections
- Dehydration
- Cancer
    - Kidney cancers…
- Tubular atrophy

Treatments

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
    - ACE inhibitors cause relaxation of blood vessels, as well as a decreased blood volume, which leads to lower blood pressure and decreased oxygen demand from the heart. They inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme, an important component of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

# References To Check

infectious diseases continue to be prevalent in low-income countries, secondary to poor sanitation, inadequate supply of safe water, and high concentrations of disease-transmitting vectors (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1548559510000388)

Environmental pollution, pesticides, analgesic abuse, herbal medications, and use of unregulated food additives also contribute to the burden of chronic kidney disease in developing countries (End-Stage Renal Care in Developing Countries: The India Experience)

Genetic factors also contribute. Variations in MYH9 and APOL1 are associated with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease in individuals of African origin (MYH9 is associated with nondiabetic end-stage renal disease in African Americans) (Genetic variation in APOL1 associates with younger age at hemodialysis initiation)
