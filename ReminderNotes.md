- BJRM 'What I Tell My Patients About...' - http://www.bjrm.co.uk/patient-information.aspx

Next find measures, treatments, symptoms and consequences for the following conditions (esp as they relate to CVD):

- Arteriosclerosis
- Bone Pain
- Bone Fracture
- Bone Deformation
- Calciphylaxis
- CKD-MBD
- Extraskeletal Calcification
- Hyperparathyroidism (Secondary)
    - Secondary hyperparathyroidism refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) and associated hyperplasia of the glands.
- Hyperphosphatemia
- Hypocalcemia
- Hypovitaminosis D
- Joint Pain
- Metastatic Calcification
- Osteoporosis
- Renal Osteodystrophy

Find information about the following measures:

- Calcium (plasma, serum, ionised serum level, etc.)
- Parathyroid Hormone (serum)
- Vitamin D (serum)
    - If calcitrol level only is measured, rather than both it and calcidiol, then you're really only measuring calcitrol level without any idea of how much calcidiol you're body is producing
        - Realy want vitamin D level (calcidiol) and activated (calcitrol)
- (Inorganic) phosphate/phosphorus (blood, plasma, serum, etc.)

Find information about the following treatments:

- Calcimimetrics
- Calcium Supplement
- Dialysis
- Parathyroidectomy
- Phosphate Binders
- Renal Transplant
- Vitamin D Replacement Therapy

Medications
- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
    - ACE inhibitors cause relaxation of blood vessels, as well as a decreased blood volume, which leads to lower blood pressure and decreased oxygen demand from the heart. They inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme, an important component of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

# References To Check

infectious diseases continue to be prevalent in low-income countries, secondary to poor sanitation, inadequate supply of safe water, and high concentrations of disease-transmitting vectors (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1548559510000388)



Environmental pollution, pesticides, analgesic abuse, herbal medications, and use of unregulated food additives also contribute to the burden of chronic kidney disease in developing countries (End-Stage Renal Care in Developing Countries: The India Experience)


Genetic factors also contribute. Variations in MYH9 and APOL1 are associated with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease in individuals of African origin (MYH9 is associated with nondiabetic end-stage renal disease in African Americans) (Genetic variation in APOL1 associates with younger age at hemodialysis initiation)
