# Notes

- Causes
    - CKD-MBD is a complication associated with CKD
    - Mineral and bone disorder in chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs when damaged kidneys and abnormal hormone levels cause calcium and phosphorus levels in a person’s blood to be out of balance. Mineral and bone disorder commonly occurs in people with CKD and affects most people with kidney failure receiving dialysis.
    - Chronic kidney disease causes mineral and bone disorder because the kidneys do not properly balance the mineral levels in the body. The kidneys
        - stop activating calcitriol. The low levels of calcitriol in the body create an imbalance of calcium in the blood.
        - do not remove the phosphorus in the blood properly, so phosphorus levels rise in the blood. The extra phosphorus pulls calcium out of the bones, causing them to weaken.
    - Another factor contributes to the cause of mineral and bone disorder. When the kidneys are damaged, the parathyroid gland releases parathyroid hormone into the blood to pull calcium from the bones and raise blood calcium levels. This response restores the balance of phosphorus and calcium; however, it also starves the bones of much-needed calcium.
- Problems Caused by CKD-MBD
    - Hormones and minerals are important because they help bones stay strong. If a person’s hormones and minerals are out of balance, his or her bones can become weak and malformed. Healthy bones continuously rebuild, sometimes taking a slightly altered shape or structure. To grow and rebuild, bones need
        - the hormone calcitriol—the active form of vitamin D
        - calcium
        - phosphorus
        - parathyroid hormone
    - The kidneys play an important role in maintaining healthy bone mass and structure by balancing phosphorus and calcium levels in the blood. Healthy kidneys activate a form of vitamin D that a person consumes in food, turning it into calcitriol, the active form of the vitamin. Calcitriol helps the kidneys maintain blood calcium levels and promotes the formation of bone.
    - The kidneys also remove extra phosphorus, helping balance phosphorus and calcium levels in the blood. Keeping the proper level of phosphorus in the blood helps maintain strong bones.
    - The parathyroid glands, four pea-sized glands in the neck, create parathyroid hormone, or PTH. Parathyroid hormone plays an important role in controlling calcium levels in the blood. When the kidneys do not function properly, extra parathyroid hormone is released into the blood to move calcium from inside the bones into the blood.
- Naming Changes
    - CKD-MBD broadens the "old" concept of "renal osteodystrophy", which now should be restricted to describing the bone pathology associated with CKD.[1][2] Thus, renal osteodystrophy is currently considered one measure of the skeletal component of the systemic disorder of CKD-MBD that is quantifiable by histomorphometry of bone biopsy.[1][3]
    - In the past, health care providers used the term “renal osteodystrophy” to describe mineral and hormone disturbances caused by kidney disease. Today, renal osteodystrophy only describes bone problems that result from mineral and bone disorder in CKD. Health care providers might use the phrase “chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder,” or CKD-MBD, to describe the condition that affects the bones, heart, and blood vessels.
- Symptoms and Complications
    - It is a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD manifested by either one or a combination of the following: 1) Abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus (phosphate), parathyroid hormone or vitamin D metabolism; 2) Abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth or strength; and 3) Vascular or other soft-tissue calcification.[1][2] CKD-MBD explains, at least in part, the high morbidity and mortality of CKD patients, linking kidney and bone disease with cardiovascular complications.
    - Eventually, a person with the condition may begin to feel bone and joint pain.
    - The complications of mineral and bone disorder in CKD include slowed bone growth and deformities, and heart and blood vessel problems.
    - Slowed Bone Growth and Deformities
        - Damaged kidneys must work harder to clear phosphorus from the body. High levels of phosphorus cause lower levels of calcium in the blood, resulting in the following series of events:
            - When a person’s blood calcium level becomes too low, the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone.
            - Parathyroid hormone removes calcium from bones and places it into the blood, raising a person’s blood calcium level at the risk of harming bones.
            - A low calcitriol level also leads to an increased level of parathyroid hormone.
        - If mineral and bone disorder in CKD remains untreated in adults, bones gradually become thin and weak, and a person with the condition may begin to feel bone and joint pain. Mineral and bone disorder in CKD also increases a person’s risk of bone fractures.
    - Heart and Blood Vessel Problems
        - In addition to harming bones, mineral and bone disorder in CKD can cause problems in the heart and blood vessels:
            - High levels of blood calcium can damage blood vessels and lead to heart problems.
            - High phosphorus levels also can cause blood vessels to become like bone, leading to hardening of the arteries.
            - High phosphorus levels also cause abnormal hormone regulation, even if the calcium level is acceptable.
        - Parathyroid hormone and another hormone made in the bones called FGF23 can also affect bone and heart health, leading to the following series of problems:
            - When parathyroid hormone or FGF23 levels are high, a person can have heart problems.
            - The complex hormone abnormalities that cause bone deformities can also harm a person’s heart and blood vessels.
- Diagnosis
    - Family and Medical History
        - Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose mineral and bone disorder in CKD. He or she will ask the patient or caretaker questions about when the patient was first diagnosed with CKD and whether any family members have also had mineral and bone disorder with or without CKD.
    - Physical Exam
        - A physical exam may help diagnose mineral and bone disorder in CKD. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines a patient’s body for changes in bone structure.
    - Blood Test
        - A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider’s office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test shows levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and sometimes vitamin D.
    - Bone Biopsy
        - A bone biopsy is a procedure that removes a piece of bone tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography scan to guide the biopsy needle into the hip bone. A pathologist—a doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases—examines the bone tissue in a lab. The test can show whether a person’s bone cells are building normal bone.
    - X-ray
        - An x-ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. A radiographer performs the x-ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging—interprets the images. Patients do not need anesthesia. The patient will lie on a table or stand during the x-ray. The technician will position the x-ray machine over the bone area. The patient will hold his or her breath as the x-ray machine takes the picture so that the picture will not be blurry. The radiographer may ask the patient to change position for additional pictures. An x-ray can show extra calcium in blood vessels.
- Treatment
    - Treating mineral and bone disorder in CKD includes preventing damage to bones by controlling parathyroid hormone levels through changes in eating, diet, and nutrition; medications and supplements; and dialysis. If these treatments do not bring parathyroid hormone levels under control, a health care provider may remove a person’s parathyroid glands surgically, a procedure called a parathyroidectomy.
    - Eating, Diet, and Nutrition
        - Changes in diet can treat mineral and bone disorder in CKD. Reducing dietary intake of phosphorus is one of the most important steps in preventing bone disease.
    - Medications and Supplements
        - Medications protect the bones by restoring the proper balance of minerals and hormones. If the kidneys do not make adequate amounts of calcitriol, a health care provider may prescribe synthetic calcitriol as a pill (Rocaltrol) or, for dialysis patients, in an injectable form (Calcijex). Calcitriol helps reduce parathyroid hormone levels. Medications called doxercalciferol (Hectorol) and paricalcitol (Zemplar) act like calcitriol because they are also activated forms of vitamin D. A health care provider may prescribe a calcium supplement in addition to calcitriol or another activated form of vitamin D.
        - Certain forms of vitamin D—available by prescription or as over-the-counter vitamin supplements—require activation by a person’s kidneys before they can act as calcitriol does. However, the benefits of some of these not-yet-activated forms of vitamin D—for example, ergocalciferol (Calciferol, Drisdol) or cholecalciferol (Delta D3)—are unclear. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of alternative medications, including use of vitamin and mineral supplements, with their health care provider.
        - Cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar) belongs to another class of prescription medications called calcimimetics. Cinacalcet lowers parathyroid hormone levels by imitating calcium’s effects on the parathyroid gland. Generally, this medication is used only in people on dialysis.
        - Often, health care providers will prescribe medications called phosphate binders—such as calcium carbonate (Tums), calcium acetate (PhosLo), sevelamer carbonate (Renvela), or lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol)—to take with meals and snacks to bind phosphorus in the bowel. These medications decrease the absorption of phosphorus into the blood.
    - Dialysis
        - Increasing a person’s dialysis dose can help control the blood phosphorus level. In hemodialysis, the health care provider can adjust the dose by increasing how quickly the blood flows to and from the dialyzer. Another way to adjust the dose involves increasing the time of a person’s dialysis session or the number of sessions. In peritoneal dialysis, using more dialysis solution in each fill or increasing the number of fills each day increases the dose. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:
    - Parathyroidectomy
        - If diet, medications, and dialysis can’t control parathyroid hormone levels, a surgeon can remove one or more of the parathyroid glands. He or she performs the procedure using general anesthesia.
