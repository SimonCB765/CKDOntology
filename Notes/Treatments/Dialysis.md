# Description

-Dialysis is the process of filtering wastes and extra fluid from the body by means other than the kidneys. The two forms of dialysis are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
- Hemodialysis
    - Hemodialysis uses a machine to circulate a person’s blood through a filter outside the body. The blood passes from a patient’s body through a needle, at nearly 1 pint per minute. The blood then travels through a tube that takes it to the filter, called a dialyzer. Inside the dialyzer, the blood flows through thin fibers that filter out wastes and extra fluid. After the machine filters the blood, it passes back to the body through another tube.
- Peritoneal Dialysis
    - Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdomen to filter a person’s blood inside the body. A soft tube called a catheter is placed in the patient’s abdomen a few weeks before peritoneal dialysis begins. A person uses the catheter to fill the empty space inside the abdomen with dialysis solution—a kind of salty water—from a plastic bag. While inside the body, the dialysis solution absorbs wastes and extra fluid. After a few hours, the person drains the used dialysis solution into another bag for disposal. The person then restarts the process with a fresh bag of dialysis solution.
