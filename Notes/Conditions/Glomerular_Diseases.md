- Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis)
- Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis

- protein and red blood cells seen in urine as they come out of the glomerullus (incorrectly) and are too big to be absorbed by the tubules (as they shouldn't be there)
