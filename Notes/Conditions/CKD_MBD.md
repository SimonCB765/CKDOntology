# Causes and Consequences

- The growth and rebuilding of bones requires careful maintenance of the levels of calcitriol (the biologically active form of vitamin D), phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood. The kidneys play an important role in this by helping to balance the levels of calcitriol and phosphate in the blood.
- CKD-MBD is a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) as damage to the kidneys can result in hormone and mineral levels in the blood becoming imbalanced. CKD-MBD commonly occurs in people with CKD, becoming apparent once kidneys are functioning at about 40% of normal, or an eGFR of 40 ml/min. Most people receiving dialysis are affected.
- There are three primary causes of this:
    1. The usual activation path of vitamin D is to be carried in the bloodstream to the liver, where it is converted into the prohormone calcidiol. Circulating calcidiol may then be converted into calcitriol in the kidneys. When damaged, the hydroxylation of calcidiol in the kidneys is reduced, resulting in the body no longer being able to absorb calcium from food in the gut and a decrease in calcium levels.
    2. The kidneys are responsible for removing the bulk of excess phosphate from the blood. When the kidneys are not working as efficiently as normal they are unable to excrete all this excess phosphate into the urine. Therefore levels of pohsphate rise.
    3. PTH is important for controlling the level of calcium in the blood. When the level of calcium in the blood falls, the parathyroid glands normally produce more PTH. PTH attempts to restore the level of calcium in the blood by increasing absorption from food, but also by pulling calcium out of the bones, thereby weakening them. The low levels of calcium in people with renal insufficiency causes the levels of PTH to rise, and consequently the calcium pulled out of the bones to increase. This results in an increase in a person's blood calcium level at the risk of harming bones.
- In addition to the abnormalities in calcium, phosphate and PTH levels, CKD-MBD can also manifest as abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth or strength and in vascular or other soft-tissue calcification. This can be seen to partially explain the high morbidity and mortality of CKD patients, as it links kidney and bone diseases with cardiovascular complications.
- Primarily CKD-MBD leads to bone diseases and cardiovascular problems.
    - If CKD-MBD remains untreated, then bones will gradually become thin and weak, and a person may begin to feel bone and joint pain. Additionally, there is potentially an increased risk of bone fracture.
    - Heart and blood vessel problems are largely caused by raised levels of calcium, phosphate and PTH. These can be as a direct consequence of homeostatic imbalances or the therapies used to correct them.
- Diagnosis will largely consist of identifying a family history of mineral and bone disorder (with or without CKD) and carrying out a blood test to measure calcium, phosphate, PTH and (sometimes) vitamin D levels. Additional tests may include bone biopsies and x-rays to identify problems with a person's bones.
- Treatment for CKD-MBD can come in many guises. These include dietary changes, medications, dialysis and ultimately surgical procedures such as a parathyroidectomy.
    - Diet and Nutrition
        - Reducing intake of phosphorus is one of the more important steps in reducing the chances of developing CKD-MBD.
    - Medication and Supplements
        - Vitamin D Medications
            - As vitamin D deficiency is one of the main causes of calcium and bone problems in people with CKD, vitamin D replacement therapy can be given as treatment (unless blood calcium and PTH levels are normal). However, as the final step needed to activate vitamin D occurs in the kidneys, and does not occur sufficiently in patients with CKD-MBD, a form of vitamin D that has already undergone this activation must be given. Commonly given medications are alfacalcidol, calcitriol, doxercalciferol and paricalcitol. Calcitriol is more effective at reducing PTH levels than alfacalcidol. A calcium supplement may also be given in addition to calcitriol or another activated form of vitamin D.
        - Phosphate Binders
            - Phosphate binders are a group of drugs that bind phosphate in the bowel and prevent the body from absorbing it. However, they only work effectively in combination with a controlled diet, and it is important that they're taken only with meals containing meat, fish, eggs, cheese, milk or pulses, as these all contain protein and therefore phosphate. Examples of phosphate binders include ones based on calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, sevelamer hydrochloride, sevelamer carbonate and lanthanum carbonate, e.g. Calcichew, Phosex, Renagel, Renvela and Fosrenol.
        - Calcimimetrics
            - Calcimimetrics mimic the action of calcium, such as cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar), and are generally used only in people on dialysis. These drugs lower PTH by imitiating calcium's effects on the parathyroid gland, thereby leading the body to 'think' that there is more calcium in the blood than there is. The reduction in PTH results in a decrease in blood calcium and phosphate levels, and can potentially enable higher doses of calcium containing phosphate binders to be used without causing an elevated blood calcium level.
    - Dialysis
        - Increasing a person’s dialysis dose can help control blood phosphate levels. In hemodialysis, the dose can be increased by increasing how quickly the blood flows to and from the dialyzer or by increasing the time of a person’s dialysis session or the number of sessions. In peritoneal dialysis, using more dialysis solution in each fill or increasing the number of fills each day will increases the dose.
    - Parathyroidectomy
        - If neither diet, medication nor dialysis can control PTH levels, one or more of the parathyroid glands can be removed surgically.
    - Renal Transplant
        - Kidney transplants may be beneficial in improving a person's ability to correctly maintain their homeoostatic balance, but will not reverse damage caused prior to the transplant.
