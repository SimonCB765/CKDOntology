        - ACE Inhibitors
            - As many of the pathophysiologic changes associated with chronic renal disease are driven by AII, ACE inhibitors have become the logical and accepted choice for treatment. ACE inhibitors block the rate-limiting step in the formation of AII. Benefits have been shown in experimental and clinical settings. These drugs preferentially dilate the efferent arteriole, thereby hemodynamically decreasing glomerular hypertension and proteinuria.196,197 They also decrease proteinuria by preserving the integrity of component proteins of the slit diaphragm198,199 and by ameliorating podocyte foot process broadening.200
            - Clinical benefits have been found for diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease.67,205- 207 In patients with diabetes, ACE inhibitors prevent progression of microalbuminuria, even in patients with controlled blood pressure. In a European study on type 1 diabetes mellitus, mean baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the group randomized to receive lisinopril were 122 and 79 mm Hg, respectively. Adjustment for effects of systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduced, but did not eliminate, this benefit.206 A meta-analysis of 12 studies involving type 1 diabetes mellitus also came to the same conclusion.208
            - Even in the presence of chronic renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitors can be used.207,209,210 The benefits are proportional to the extent of proteinuria.67,210 Improvement in proteinuria is evident within the first 2 months.67,211 The preservation of GFR is directly proportional to the extent of lowering of proteinuria, which thus serves as a useful prognostic indicator.67,212
        - Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
            - Because ACE can be formed by non–ACE-dependent pathways and because of intolerance to ACE inhibitors in many patients, ARBs have been increasingly used to delay progression of renal damage. Experimentally, ARBs have been shown to block fibroblast proliferation and synthesis of TGF-β.201 As in the case of ACE inhibitors, multiple mechanisms are responsible for the antiproteinuric effect.
            - Recent clinical trials have shown that these agents diminish proteinuria215- 217 and protect against renal function decline among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy.215,216 The 2 largest studies have been done on patients with relatively mild azotemia. However, results from studies using ACE inhibitors suggest that ARBs may be beneficial even in patients with more advanced chronic renal failure.
        - Calcium-Channel Blockers
            - Dihydropyridines do not have antiproteinuric effects.210,225 Nondihydropyridines, in contrast, appear to have some role, at least in diabetic nephropathy.226,227 There are no good data on its usage in nondiabetic nephropathies for retarding progression of renal disease, although plans for a multicenter study were recently published to investigate combined treatment with an ACE inhibitor and either a dihydropyridine or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, using proteinuria as an end point.228
        - β-Blockers
            - Though smaller studies had suggested that β-blockers may worsen the decline of GFR in patients with diabetes,227,229 the larger UKPDS-39 study found atenolol and captopril to be equivalent in limiting progression of albuminuria and azotemia over 4 years.230 Interestingly, a recent animal study found that blocking the sympathetic nervous system may be beneficial independent of antihypertensive effects.231 In a multicenter prospective study of nondiabetic African Americans with hypertensive renal disease, metoprolol was comparable with ramipril in reduction of proteinuria and in progression to end-stage renal disease.232 However, a composite end point and the overall rate of GFR decline was worse with metoprolol, suggesting that ACE inhibitors should still be the preferred agents in this population.
