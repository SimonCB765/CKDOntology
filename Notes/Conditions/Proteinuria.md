- Proteinuria
    - [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
        - Proteinuria occurs as a result of glomerular capillary hypertension and varies directly with the intraglomerular pressure. The resulting damage to the permeability barrier in the glomerulus, a mechanism at least in part mediated by angiotensin II, leads to an excess of proteins reaching the lumen of the proximal tubules. Filtered proteins are taken up by the tubular cells by endocytosis and stimulate the abnormal production of cytokines which are released into the interstitium leading to macrophage and T lymphocyte migration, the proliferation of fibroblasts and increased ECM production: the familiar mechanisms of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis [27].
        - Consistent with this role in pathophysiology, proteinuria is a strong predictor of clinical progression of CKD, the rapidity of progression is proportional to the severity of proteinuria [29].

        - Proteinuria occurs as a result of glomerular capillary hypertension and damage to the permeability barrier in the glomerulus. Protein leaking across the glomerulus is taken up by the proximal tubule cells by endocytosis. This causes protein overload on the proximal tubular cells, leading to increased activation of the intrarenal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)54 and also, either directly or via activation of transcription factors,55 to abnormal production of the following cytokines: ET-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted).56 The cytokines favor fibrosis, apoptosis, and monocytic infiltration, further propagating the process.
        - In proteinuric animals, there is also direct translocation of growth factors such as TGF-β and hepatocyte growth factor directly from plasma into tubular fluid. These then interact with receptors located at the apical membrane of tubular cells to promote interstitial fibrosis.57,58
        - Consistent with its role in pathophysiology, proteinuria is a strong predictor of clinical progression of renal disease. The rapidity of GFR decline is proportional to the severity of proteinuria.67
    - [ref][AbbateProgression]
        - This review’s main focus is on underlying mechanisms of tubulointerstitial injury that are activated by ultrafiltered protein load of tubular epithelial cells.
        - The strong predictive value of proteinuria in chronic nephropathies now is firmly established. Baseline proteinuria was an independent predictor of renal outcome in patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy (1) and in patients who did not have diabetes and entered the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study (2). In the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial (3), urinary protein excretion was the only baseline variable that correlated significantly with GFR decline and progression of nondiabetic chronic proteinuric nephropathies to ESRD. Similar evidence was provided recently in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy (4). Other studies corroborated these data and extended the predictive value of proteinuria to risks for overall or cardiovascular mortality (5,6).
        - Finding that the rate of GFR decline correlated negatively with proteinuria reduction and positively with residual proteinuria provided further evidence for a pathogenetic role of proteinuria (9).
        - In progressive nephropathies, severe dysfunction of the glomerular capillary barrier to circulating proteins causes protein overload of tubular epithelial cells and intrarenal activation of complement that is responsible for spreading of injury to the tubulointerstitium.
    - [ref][RusterProteinuria]
        - Besides hypertension, proteinuria is one of the most important risk factors for the progression of renal diseases. As outlined in detail in the accompanying article by Remuzzi et al., increased tubular absorption of filtered proteins induces tubulointerstitial inflammation, ultimately resulting in tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal function.
        - The RAAS plays an important role in many of the pathophysiologic processes that are associated with proteinuria. First, AngII is a mediator of proteinuria. It preferentially raises efferent glomerular arteriole resistance. AngII induces TGF-β1 in the various renal cells (25). Sharma et al. (26) recently showed that TGF-β1 impairs the autoregulation by afferent arterioles. Because afferent arterioles respond to an increase in arterial pressure with vasoconstriction, impaired autoregulation in the presence of TGF-β1 leads to an elevation in transcapillary pressure, particularly during systemic hypertension. Thus, AngII directly (efferent vasoconstriction) and indirectly (TGF-β1–mediated impaired afferent arteriole autoregulation) enhances capillary filtration pressure.

        - ACE Inhibitors
            - As many of the pathophysiologic changes associated with chronic renal disease are driven by AII, ACE inhibitors have become the logical and accepted choice for treatment. ACE inhibitors block the rate-limiting step in the formation of AII. Benefits have been shown in experimental and clinical settings. These drugs preferentially dilate the efferent arteriole, thereby hemodynamically decreasing glomerular hypertension and proteinuria.196,197 They also decrease proteinuria by preserving the integrity of component proteins of the slit diaphragm198,199 and by ameliorating podocyte foot process broadening.200
            - Clinical benefits have been found for diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease.67,205- 207 In patients with diabetes, ACE inhibitors prevent progression of microalbuminuria, even in patients with controlled blood pressure. In a European study on type 1 diabetes mellitus, mean baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the group randomized to receive lisinopril were 122 and 79 mm Hg, respectively. Adjustment for effects of systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduced, but did not eliminate, this benefit.206 A meta-analysis of 12 studies involving type 1 diabetes mellitus also came to the same conclusion.208
            - Even in the presence of chronic renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitors can be used.207,209,210 The benefits are proportional to the extent of proteinuria.67,210 Improvement in proteinuria is evident within the first 2 months.67,211 The preservation of GFR is directly proportional to the extent of lowering of proteinuria, which thus serves as a useful prognostic indicator.67,212
        - Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
            - Because ACE can be formed by non–ACE-dependent pathways and because of intolerance to ACE inhibitors in many patients, ARBs have been increasingly used to delay progression of renal damage. Experimentally, ARBs have been shown to block fibroblast proliferation and synthesis of TGF-β.201 As in the case of ACE inhibitors, multiple mechanisms are responsible for the antiproteinuric effect.
            - Recent clinical trials have shown that these agents diminish proteinuria215- 217 and protect against renal function decline among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy.215,216 The 2 largest studies have been done on patients with relatively mild azotemia. However, results from studies using ACE inhibitors suggest that ARBs may be beneficial even in patients with more advanced chronic renal failure.
        - Calcium-Channel Blockers
            - Dihydropyridines do not have antiproteinuric effects.210,225 Nondihydropyridines, in contrast, appear to have some role, at least in diabetic nephropathy.226,227 There are no good data on its usage in nondiabetic nephropathies for retarding progression of renal disease, although plans for a multicenter study were recently published to investigate combined treatment with an ACE inhibitor and either a dihydropyridine or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, using proteinuria as an end point.228
        - β-Blockers
            - Though smaller studies had suggested that β-blockers may worsen the decline of GFR in patients with diabetes,227,229 the larger UKPDS-39 study found atenolol and captopril to be equivalent in limiting progression of albuminuria and azotemia over 4 years.230 Interestingly, a recent animal study found that blocking the sympathetic nervous system may be beneficial independent of antihypertensive effects.231 In a multicenter prospective study of nondiabetic African Americans with hypertensive renal disease, metoprolol was comparable with ramipril in reduction of proteinuria and in progression to end-stage renal disease.232 However, a composite end point and the overall rate of GFR decline was worse with metoprolol, suggesting that ACE inhibitors should still be the preferred agents in this population.
