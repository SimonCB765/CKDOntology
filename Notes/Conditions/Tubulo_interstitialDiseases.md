# Names

# Definition


- disease of renal tubules or interstitium
- result in impaired resorptive capacity
- BUN not being reabsorbed so is greater BUN:Cr greater than normal
- can't conecentrate urine
    - water and sodium reabsorption imparied
    - can't bring sodium back into bloodstream
        - urine sodium high
    - urine osmolality will be about the same as blood
    - isothenuria
- hematuria and proteinuria are rare

- Acute Tubular Necrosis
    - A kidney disorder involving damage to and death of the tubular epithelial cells that form the renal tubules of the kidneys.
    - Ischemic hypoperfusion
    - This is obviousy acute, and I believe it is pretty much recovered from if the cause is removed (basically you get supportive care)

- Tubulo-interstitial Nephritis
    - Allergic
        - If these are acute and recoverable, then it doesn't matter for CKD
        - Drugs
