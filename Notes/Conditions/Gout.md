# Causes and Consequences

- Gout may occur in otherwise healthy people. However, patients with CKD suffer gout more commonly because they often have high levels of uric acid (or urate) in their blood. This is mainly because their kidneys are less effective at removing uric acid from their blood. Patients with CKD may also take medicines (such as water tablets or diuretics) or have other medical conditions (such as high blood pressure) that lead to higher levels of uric acid. The uric acid forms crystals within the patient’s joints. These crystals lead to inflammation and the affected joint becomes hot, red and swollen. Gout can be extremely painful. Any joint may be affected but the big toe is the most common site
- Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Brufen®, Abbott, UK) or diclofenac (Voltarol®, Novartis, UK) are the most common treatment for gout in patients without kidney disease, they should be avoided in patients with CKD. A tablet called colchicine is often used instead. This is a very effective treatment for gout, but some patients find that it causes diarrhoea, in which case it should be stopped. If possible, colchicine tablets should be taken at the very beginning of an attack. A short course of steroids (such as prednisolone tablets) may also be used
- Dietitians can help patients reduce the amount of uric acid they ingest in their food. Patients with gout should reduce their consumption of beer, wine, yeasts (for example, Marmite®), red meats (especially liver) and certain fish (particularly anchovies, herring and mackerel). The drugs used to treat acute attacks of gout will not help to prevent further episodes. If the attacks become frequent, medications to lower the levels of uric acid in the blood might be considered; the most common of which is called allopurinol
