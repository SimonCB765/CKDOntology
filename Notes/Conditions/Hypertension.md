        - The renal benefit of treatment depends to a significant extent on the underlying proteinuria. This was borne out in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study, which consisted of 2 randomized clinical trials. Study 1 evaluated patients with GFRs of 25 to 55 mL/min, while study 2 evaluated patients with GFRs of 13 to 24 mL/min. In both studies, patients were randomized to groups with mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals of either 92 mm Hg or 107 mm Hg. The decline in GFR was found to be slower in the more aggressively treated group overall, and the benefit was in direct proportion to the severity of the baseline proteinuria.190
        - In renal disease from type 1 diabetes mellitus, tighter blood pressure control, independent of use of ACE inhibitors, decreases proteinuria.191 A recent study from the Steno Diabetes Center showed that tight blood pressure control (MAP goal of 93 mm Hg) in this population can decrease the GFR decline to that found with normal aging.192
        - Thus, to slow down GFR decline, the goal for patients without diabetes with significant proteinuria involving at least 1 g/d and for patients with diabetes is to lower the MAP to the low 90s. Based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study data, Peterson and coworkers195 have suggested a MAP goal of 98 mm Hg or lower for patients with proteinuria involving between 0.25 and 1 g/d.
