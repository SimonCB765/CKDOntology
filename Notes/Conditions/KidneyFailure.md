    - Kidney failure is traditionally regarded as the most serious outcome of chronic kidney disease and symptoms are usually caused by complications of reduced kidney function. When symptoms are severe they can be treated only by dialysis and transplantation; kidney failure treated this way is known as end-stage renal disease. Kidney failure is defined as a GFR of less than 15 mL/min per 1·73 m2, or the need for treatment with dialysis or transplantation.
