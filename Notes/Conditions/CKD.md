# Causes and Consequences

- Chronic kidney disease is kidney damage that occurs slowly over many years, often due to diabetes or high blood pressure. Once damaged, the kidneys can’t filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in the body and other problems that can harm a person’s health, including mineral and bone disorder.

- Causes
    - Hypertension - over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly
    - diabetes – too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys
    - high cholesterol – this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly
    - infection
    - glomerulonephritis – kidney inflammation
    - inherited
        - polycystic kidney disease – an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys
    - blockages in the flow of urine – for example, from recurrent kidney stones or an enlarged prostate
    - long-term, regular use of certain medicines – such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- Tests/Diagnoses
    - blood test
        - creatinine
        - eGFR
    - urine test
        - albumin and creatinine in your urine – known as the albumin:creatinine ratio, or ACR
        - blood in urine
        - protein in urine
    - kidney biopsy – a small sample of kidney tissue is removed using a needle so the cells can be examined under a microscope for signs of damage
    - scans
        - an ultrasound scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan – to see what the kidneys look like and check whether there are any blockages

- Treatments
    - Lifestyle Changes
        - smoking cessation
        - dietary changes
        - reduce salt intake
        - exercise
        - reduce alcohol consumption
        - lose weight
        - avoiding medicines (e.g. over the counter NSAIDs)
    - Mainly treat other diseases
