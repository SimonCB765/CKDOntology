# Causes and Consequences

- Chronic kidney disease is kidney damage that occurs slowly over many years, often due to diabetes or high blood pressure. Once damaged, the kidneys can’t filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in the body and other problems that can harm a person’s health, including mineral and bone disorder.

- Causes
    - The most common recognised cause of CKD is diabetes mellitus. Others include idiopathic (i.e. unknown cause, often associated with small kidneys on renal ultrasound), hypertension, and glomerulonephritis.[20] Together, these cause about 75% of all adult cases.
    
    - Hypertension - over time, this can put strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys and stop the kidneys working properly
    - diabetes – too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys
    - high cholesterol – this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly
    - infection
    - glomerulonephritis – kidney inflammation
    - inherited
        - polycystic kidney disease – an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys
    - Urological factors that may reduce eGFR
        - Kidney Stones
        - obstruction/lower urinary tract symptoms (from published QICKD protocol)
        - prostate disease (from published QICKD protocol)
        - result of longstanding blockage to the urinary system (such as enlarged prostate or kidney stones)
        - blockages in the flow of urine – for example, from recurrent kidney stones or an enlarged prostate (prostate disease)
    - long-term, regular use of certain medicines – such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
    - Chronic pylonephritis is a persistent infection of the kidneys – damage can be caused that contributes to CKD and eventual kidney failure.
    - Vascular disease includes large vessel disease such as bilateral renal artery stenosis and small vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and vasculitis.
    - Glomerular disease comprises a diverse group and is classified into:
        - Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis)
        - Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis
    - Congenital disease such as polycystic kidney disease.
    - Tubulointerstitial disease includes drug- and toxin-induced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and reflux nephropathy.
    - Obstructive nephropathy is exemplified by bilateral kidney stones and diseases of the prostate.
    - Nephritis
        - Duno if I should assume that these can cause CKD...they can cause permanent damage so presumably can drop your eGFR low enough and for long enough to count as CKD
        - Pyelonephritis
        - (Tubulo-)Interstitial Nephritis
            - In most cases caused by a drug.
            - Acute will often recover function..either way it is acute not chronic
            - Chronic has no cure
            - I am assuming that chronic (and acute) can cause CKD as the eGFR can drop permanently
        - Glomerulonephritis
            - Definitely leads to CKD - (a family of different forms of kidney inflammation) can lead to CKD. These conditions affect the glomeruli, the fine filters in our kidneys. At one time, these diseases were collectively known as Bright’s Disease – before modern research identified them as separate conditions.
            - Infection related chronic Glomerulonephritis is a major cause of CKD in sub-Saharan Africa (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272638607015995)
            - Lupus nephritis

- Signs and Symptoms
    - Blood pressure is increased due to fluid overload and production of vasoactive hormones created by the kidney via the renin-angiotensin system, increasing one's risk of developing hypertension and/or suffering from congestive heart failure.
    - Urea accumulates, leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic circulation, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates ("uremic frost").
    - Potassium accumulates in the blood (hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias). Hyperkalemia usually does not develop until the glomerular filtration rate falls to less than 20-25 ml/min/1.73 m2, at which point the kidneys have decreased ability to excrete potassium. Hyperkalemia in CKD can be exacerbated by acidemia (which leads to extracellular shift of potassium) and from lack of insulin.[8]
    - Erythropoietin synthesis is decreased causing anemia.
    - Fluid volume overload symptoms may range from mild edema to life-threatening pulmonary edema.
    - Hyperphosphatemia, due to reduced phosphate excretion, follows the decrease in glomerular filtration. Hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, being a direct stimulus to vascular calcification.[9] Moreover, circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) increase progressively as the renal capacity for phosphate excretion declines, but this adaptative response may also contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased mortality in CKD patients.[10][11]
    - Hypocalcemia, due to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 deficiency (caused by stimulation of FGF-23 and reduction of renal mass),[12] and resistance to the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone.[13] Osteocytes are responsible for the increased production of FGF-23, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3).[14] Later, this progresses to secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function. An extreme consequence is the occurrence of the rare condition named calciphylaxis.[15]
    - Metabolic acidosis (due to accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, uric acid etc.) may cause altered enzyme activity by excess acid acting on enzymes; and also increased excitability of cardiac and neuronal membranes by the promotion of hyperkalemia due to excess acid (acidemia).[17] Acidosis is also due to decreased capacity to generate enough ammonia from the cells of the proximal tubule.[8]
    - Iron deficiency anemia, which increases in prevalence as kidney function decreases, is especially prevalent in those requiring haemodialysis. It is multifactoral in cause, but includes increased inflammation, reduction in erythropoietin, and hyperuricemia leading to bone marrow suppression.
    
- Consequnces
    - Renovascular Disease
        - Atherosclerotic Renovascular Disease
        - During the progression of kidney disease, renal function becomes less and less efficient. This can often lead to renal vascular disease – a condition that narrows the blood vessels carrying blood to the kidneys. This is frequently associated with high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney failure
    - Atherosclerosis
    - CVD

- Tests/Diagnoses
    - blood test
        - creatinine
        - eGFR
    - urine test
        - albumin and creatinine in your urine – known as the albumin:creatinine ratio, or ACR
        - blood in urine
        - protein in urine
    - kidney biopsy – a small sample of kidney tissue is removed using a needle so the cells can be examined under a microscope for signs of damage
    - scans
        - an ultrasound scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan – to see what the kidneys look like and check whether there are any blockages

- Treatments
    - Lifestyle Changes
        - smoking cessation
        - dietary changes
        - reduce salt intake
        - exercise
        - reduce alcohol consumption
        - lose weight
        - avoiding medicines (e.g. over the counter NSAIDs)
    - Mainly treat other diseases
    - Dialysis
