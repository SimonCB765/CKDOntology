Chronic Renal Insufficiency

# Definition
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a general term for a range of heterogeneous disorders affecting the structure and function of the kidney CKD manifests as a progressive loss of renal function over time, and is defined as "abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for at least 3 months, with implications for health" [ref][KDIGO2012]. Classification of CKD is based on cause, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria category (i.e. the severity of kidney damage) [ref][KDIGO2012]. Categories of GFR are:

- G1 - Normal or high - GFR >= 90 mL/min/1.73 m2
- G2 - Mildly decreased - GFR in the range 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2
- G3a - Mild to moderately decreased - GFR in the range 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m2
- G3b - Moderately to severely decreased - GFR in the range 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2
- G4 - Severely decreased - GFR in the range 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2
- G5 - Kidney failure - GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2

Categories for albuminuria are:

- A1 - Normal to mildly increased - albumin-to-creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol)
- A2 - Moderately increased - albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the range 30-300 mg/g (3-30 mg/mmol)
- A3 - Severely increased - albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g (30 mg/mmol)

Risk can then be classified as one of four categories:

- Green - low risk (and if no other markers of kidney disease then no CKD) - G1+A1 or G2+A1
- Yellow - moderately increased risk - G3a+A1, G1+A2 or G2+A2
- Orange - high risk - G3b+A1, G3a+A2, G1+A3 or G2+A3
- Red - very high risk - all other combinations

# Progression

While the rate of progression varies substantially between patients, CKD is characterised by a progressive deterioration in renal function, as evidenced by a decreasing GFR. Despite the wide range of pathological processes that contribute to renal injury, they converge on a common pathway by which they cause progressive renal destruction, characterised morphologically and pathophysiologically by (myo)fibroblast and/or macrophage infiltration, progressive interstitial fibrosis, tubular hypoxia caused by peritubular capillary loss and a decline in functioning nephrons due to tubular atrophy ([ref][EddyProgression] and [ref][YuProgression]). Numerous secondary factors unrelated to the initial disease, such as glomerular hemodynamics, proteinuria and hypertension, have been shown to mediate the rate of CKD progression ([ref][YuProgression]).


- [ref][LeveyCKD]
    - Early stages of disease are often asymptomatic, are detected during the assessment of comorbid disorders, and can be reversible. Rapidly progressive diseases can lead to kidney failure within months; however, most diseases evolve over decades and some patients do not progress during many years of follow-up.
    - Kidney damage as defined by structural abnormalities or functional abnormalities other than decreased GFR (select cutdown list)
        - Pathological abnormalities
            - Glomerular diseases (diabetes, autoimmune diseases, systemic infections, drugs, neoplasia)
            - Vascular diseases (atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischaemia, vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy)
            - Tubulointerstitial diseases (urinary-tract infections, stones, obstruction, toxic effects of drugs)
            - Cystic disease (polycystic kidney disease)
        - Abnormalities in urinary sediment as markers of kidney damage
            - Red-blood-cell casts in proliferative glomerulonephritis
            - White-blood-cell casts in pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis
            - Oval fat bodies or fatty casts in diseases with proteinuria
            - Granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells in many parenchymal diseases (non-specific)
        - Imaging abnormalities as markers of kidney damage (ultrasound, CT, and MRI with or without contrast, isotope scans, angiography)
            - Polycystic kidneys
            - Hydronephrosis due to obstruction
            - Cortical scarring due to infarcts, pyelonephritis, or vesicoureteral reflux
            - Renal masses or enlarged kidneys due to infiltrative diseases
            - Renal artery stenosis
            - Small and echogenic kidneys (common in late stages of CKD because of many parenchymal diseases)
        - Renal tubular syndromes as markers of kidney damage
            - Renal tubular acidosis
            - Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
            - Barrter and Gittelman syndromes
            - Fanconi's syndrome
            - Cystinuria
            - Familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis
    - Other outcomes include complications of reduced GFR, such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease, acute kidney injury, infection, cognitive impairment, and impaired physical function.20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 Complications can occur at any stage, which often lead to death with no progression to kidney failure, and can arise from adverse effects of interventions to prevent or treat the disease.
    - Hypetension
        - Hypertension is attributed to salt retention and increased vascular tone due to a failure to suppress the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system, inhibition of sodium-potassium ATPase, and nitric-oxide deficiency.70
    - Anemia
        - Anaemia is caused mainly by decreased production of erythropoietin by the peritubular cells, and bone-marrow unresponsiveness to erythropoietin, indicating systemic inflammation, increased hepcidin production by the liver, and decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis.71
    - Glomerular disease
        - Nephrotic syndrome is one of the main clinical presentations of glomerular disease (panel 1), indicating the pathophysiological effects of losses of large quantities of urinary albumin and other serum proteins, such as immunoglobulins, growth factors, components of the complement, and coagulation cascades. The clinical manifestations are related to the underlying clinical diagnosis and severity of proteinuria.91, 92 and 93
    - CVD
        - Cardiovascular disease is considered separately from other complications of chronic kidney disease because it is the most frequent outcome of chronic kidney disease, and because chronic kidney disease is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.105, 106 and 107 Studies of several populations show that low GFR and high albuminuria are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, de-novo and recurrent cardiovascular events, and subclinical cardiovascular disease. Pathophysiological links between cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease include a high prevalence of traditional and non-traditional risk factors, including hypertension; fluid overload; electrolyte, acid-base, and mineral disorders; anaemia; dyslipidaemia; inflammation; increased oxidative stress; and prothrombotic stimuli.108, 109 and 110 However, these associations do not prove causation. Other possible explanations are the high prevalence of shared risk factors for both diseases, and reverse causation, because cardiovascular disease is now recognised as a risk factor for GFR decline.111 and 112
    - Causes
        - In developed countries, chronic kidney disease is generally associated with old age, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, with diabetic glomerulosclerosis and hypertensive nephrosclerosis as the presumed pathological entities; however, exact diagnosis is often difficult.25
        - Diabetic glomerulosclerosis is characterised by slowly worsening albuminuria, hypertension, and progressive decline in GFR, sometimes with nephrotic syndrome.
        - Hypertensive nephrosclerosis has no distinct markers of kidney damage, but high-normal to high concentrations of albuminuria can occur after the onset of decreased GFR.
        - Many patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease do not have typical features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis, and pathological findings of hypertensive nephrosclerosis are often more severe than expected because of the level of blood pressure.
        - The presence of red-blood-cell or white-blood-cell casts, or specific imaging abnormalities, suggest another cause of kidney disease. In developing countries, common causes of chronic kidney disease also include glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases resulting from infections and exposure to drugs and toxins.
        - diseases or conditions that cause CKDâ€”ie, risk factors for CVD (hypertension, diabetes, obesity), CVD, autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis), infections (bacteria, HBV, HCV, HIV, schistosomiasis, malaria), drugs or toxins (NSAID, iodinated radiographic contrast, aristolochic acid)
    - Tests
        - Although albumin assays are expensive, measurement of an albumin to creatinine ratio in untimed spot urine has many advantages and is recommended by guidelines.43 and 44
    - Treatments
        - The most consistent benefit is noted with use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), usually in association with diuretic drugs, in patients with high concentrations of albuminuria.

- Intra-glomerular Hemodynamics
    - [ref][AbbateProgression]
        - Independent of the underlying causes, chronic proteinuric glomerulopathies have in common a sustained or permanent loss of selectivity of the glomerular barrier to protein filtration. Glomerular sclerosis is the progressive lesion beginning at the glomerular capillary wall, the site of abnormal filtration of plasma proteins. Injury is transmitted to the interstitium favoring the self-destruction of nephrons and eventually of the kidney.
    - [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
        - The loss of sufficient renal functional units (nephrons) from whatever insult, puts into place haemodynamic factors that perpetuate renal dysfunction. Indirect studies in humans strongly indicate a very similar response to those that are demonstrated in many animal models of progressive CKD, with increased intraglomerular pressure, glomerular hypertrophy and compensatory glomerular hyperfiltration.
        - The compensatory response to nephron loss of hyperfiltration in the spared nephrons, in an attempt to maintain GFR, leads to glomerular injury and the finding on renal biopsy examination of secondary glomerulosclerosis.
        - Glomerular cell proliferation, macrophage infiltration and the progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components all may contribute to the development of the glomerular sclerotic lesion, stretching of the capillary tuft also stretches the adjacent mesangial cells and this induces mesangial proliferation.
        - Early diabetic nephropathy is well described to be associated with hyperfiltration resulting in an elevation of GFR with associated glomerular hypertrophy [8,9]. Primary renal vasodilatation, with a greater reduction in afferent relative to efferent arteriolar resistance results in increased intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration.
        - There is correlation between urine albumin excretion and glomerular pressure, and therefore, as with the remnant kidney model, the glomerular hypertension in diabetic nephropathy propagates a decline in GFR at least partly due to increased protein leakage across glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space [10].
        - The mechanisms underlying this afferent arteriolar dilatation in diabetics are not well understood, but may include factors related to hyperglycemia
        - Hyperfiltration has not been so well studied in non-diabetic renal disease but has been described in sickle cell anaemia, lupus nephritis, obesity and in white hypertensives with reduced numbers of hypertrophied glomeruli suggesting compensatory hyperfiltration [15].
        - Intraglomerular pressure may be raised in glomerular diseases as a compensatory adaptation to a reduction in the permeability of the glomerular capillary wall to small solutes and water. The fall in GFR is minimized by raising the intraglomerular pressure, a response that may be mediated by reduced flow to the macula densa and subsequent activation of tubuloglomerular feedback.
        - Intraglomerular hypertension and hypertrophy may further cause damage and progression of CKD as the increased wall stress and increased glomerular diameter cause detachment of the glomerular epithelial cells from the glomerular capillary wall. These areas allow increased flux of water and solutes; however, very large circulating macromolecules (such as IgM and fibrinogen and complement metabolites) cannot cross the glomerular basement membrane and are trapped in the subendothelial space. The characteristic accumulation of these â€˜hyalineâ€™ deposits can progressively narrow the capillary lumens, thereby decreasing glomerular perfusion and filtration [16].
    - [ref][YuProgression]
        - In rats subjected to subtotal nephrectomy, compensatory hyperfiltration of the spared nephrons helps to maintain overall GFR. However, this adaptation also leads to glomerular hypertension, proteinuria, and progressive chronic renal failure.35 The stretching of the capillary tuft also stretches the adjacent mesangial cells, which induces mesangial cell proliferation and glomerulosclerosis at least partly by overexpression of cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)36 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1.37
        - Early diabetic nephropathy is well known to be associated with an elevated GFR.38- 40 Experimentally, increased glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure and hyperfiltration occur (despite normal systemic pressures) due to a proportionally greater reduction in the afferent relative to efferent arteriolar resistance.41 Indirect measurements suggest that glomerular capillary hypertension is present in human patients with diabetes as well, and there is also a correlation between urine albumin excretion and the glomerular pressure but not systemic pressure. Thus, as in the remnant kidney model, the glomerular hypertension in diabetic nephropathy itself propagates chronic GFR decline, at least partly by increasing protein leakage across the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman space.42
- Tubulo-interstitial Disease
    - Tubulointerstitial disease includes drug- and toxin-induced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and reflux nephropathy.
    - [ref][AbbateProgression]
        - Several lines of evidence suggested a role of glomerular ultrafiltrate of plasma proteins or protein-associated factors in chronic tubulointerstitial damage.
    - [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
        - Impairment of kidney function correlates better with the degree of tubulo-interstitial injury and fibrosis than with histologically evident glomerular injury. Interstitial fibrosis results from increased synthesis and decreased breakdown of ECM [17].
        - In CKD, the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is disordered with excessive apoptosis of normal glomerular and tubular epithelial cells. Abnormally abundant apoptotic stimuli such as TGF-Î², tumour necrosis factor (TNF), Fas ligand (FasL) and interferon-Î± result in increased cell death [18,19]. Tissue hypoxia from decreased perfusion of the microvasculature also stimulates FasL-mediated apoptosis. Hypoxia may be a cause as well as an effect of the progression of CKD; intertubular capillaries are reduced in CKD of all causes, an effect exacerbated by glomerular sclerosis. Increased interstitium also diminishes capillary perfusion of the tubules.
        - An excess of cytokines in the kidney in CKD recruits macrophages into the kidney; macrophage-colony stimulating factor is over expressed by the tubules as a response to injury. Macrophage infiltration of the interstitium correlates with renal dysfunction and the cells amplify the response by producing more cytokines further inducing fibrosis and apoptosis.
    - [ref][YuProgression]
        - Interstitial fibrosis results from increased synthesis and decreased breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM). The abnormal ECM contains an excess of normal components such as fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycans, and type IV collagen.
- Hypertension
    - [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
        - Systemic hypertension is common in CKD and incidence increases with declining GFR [25]. Hypertension is due to a combination of sodium and water excess, activation of the reninâ€“angiotensinâ€“aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system activation. Systemic hypertension is transmitted causing glomerular capillary hypertension and a subsequent accelerated decline in GFR as outlined above (intra-glomerular haemodynamic factors).
    - [ref][YuProgression]
        - Systemic hypertension is a frequent accompaniment to chronic renal disease. Sodium, volume excess, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with chronic renal failure all cause hypertension. In addition, afferent stimuli from the kidneys may activate the sympathetic nervous system and contribute to the elevated pressure.68 Hypertension itself accelerates decline in renal function,69- 71 likely due to the associated increased glomerular capillary hypertension.
- Proteinuria
    - [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
        - Proteinuria occurs as a result of glomerular capillary hypertension and varies directly with the intraglomerular pressure. The resulting damage to the permeability barrier in the glomerulus, a mechanism at least in part mediated by angiotensin II, leads to an excess of proteins reaching the lumen of the proximal tubules. Filtered proteins are taken up by the tubular cells by endocytosis and stimulate the abnormal production of cytokines which are released into the interstitium leading to macrophage and T lymphocyte migration, the proliferation of fibroblasts and increased ECM production: the familiar mechanisms of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis [27].
        - Consistent with this role in pathophysiology, proteinuria is a strong predictor of clinical progression of CKD, the rapidity of progression is proportional to the severity of proteinuria [29].
    - [ref][YuProgression]
        - Proteinuria occurs as a result of glomerular capillary hypertension and damage to the permeability barrier in the glomerulus. Protein leaking across the glomerulus is taken up by the proximal tubule cells by endocytosis. This causes protein overload on the proximal tubular cells, leading to increased activation of the intrarenal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)54 and also, either directly or via activation of transcription factors,55 to abnormal production of the following cytokines: ET-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted).56 The cytokines favor fibrosis, apoptosis, and monocytic infiltration, further propagating the process.
        - In proteinuric animals, there is also direct translocation of growth factors such as TGF-Î² and hepatocyte growth factor directly from plasma into tubular fluid. These then interact with receptors located at the apical membrane of tubular cells to promote interstitial fibrosis.57,58
        - Consistent with its role in pathophysiology, proteinuria is a strong predictor of clinical progression of renal disease. The rapidity of GFR decline is proportional to the severity of proteinuria.67
    - [ref][AbbateProgression]
        - This reviewâ€™s main focus is on underlying mechanisms of tubulointerstitial injury that are activated by ultrafiltered protein load of tubular epithelial cells.
        - The strong predictive value of proteinuria in chronic nephropathies now is firmly established. Baseline proteinuria was an independent predictor of renal outcome in patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy (1) and in patients who did not have diabetes and entered the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study (2). In the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy (REIN) trial (3), urinary protein excretion was the only baseline variable that correlated significantly with GFR decline and progression of nondiabetic chronic proteinuric nephropathies to ESRD. Similar evidence was provided recently in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy (4). Other studies corroborated these data and extended the predictive value of proteinuria to risks for overall or cardiovascular mortality (5,6).
        - Finding that the rate of GFR decline correlated negatively with proteinuria reduction and positively with residual proteinuria provided further evidence for a pathogenetic role of proteinuria (9).
        - In progressive nephropathies, severe dysfunction of the glomerular capillary barrier to circulating proteins causes protein overload of tubular epithelial cells and intrarenal activation of complement that is responsible for spreading of injury to the tubulointerstitium.
    - [ref][RusterProteinuria]
        - Besides hypertension, proteinuria is one of the most important risk factors for the progression of renal diseases. As outlined in detail in the accompanying article by Remuzzi et al., increased tubular absorption of filtered proteins induces tubulointerstitial inflammation, ultimately resulting in tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal function.
        - The RAAS plays an important role in many of the pathophysiologic processes that are associated with proteinuria. First, AngII is a mediator of proteinuria. It preferentially raises efferent glomerular arteriole resistance. AngII induces TGF-Î²1 in the various renal cells (25). Sharma et al. (26) recently showed that TGF-Î²1 impairs the autoregulation by afferent arterioles. Because afferent arterioles respond to an increase in arterial pressure with vasoconstriction, impaired autoregulation in the presence of TGF-Î²1 leads to an elevation in transcapillary pressure, particularly during systemic hypertension. Thus, AngII directly (efferent vasoconstriction) and indirectly (TGF-Î²1â€“mediated impaired afferent arteriole autoregulation) enhances capillary filtration pressure.
- Hyperlipidaemia
    - [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
        - Hyperlipidaemia is common in patients with CKD, particularly those with heavy proteinuria. In addition to the adverse effects upon systemic atherosclerosis, there is some evidence that hyperlipidaemia may also have an adverse impact upon progression of CKD [30,31]. Hyperlipidaemia activates mesangial cells, leading to mesangial proliferation, production of macrophage chemotactic factors, stimulation of reactive oxygen species and stimulation of growth factor and cytokine release. All of these factors may then contribute to renal injury and progression of CKD.
    - [ref][YuProgression]
        - Chronic renal failure is associated with elevation of triglyceride levels, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein (a), and decreased apolipoprotein (a). Renal failure itself may also promote hyperlipidemia by down-regulating the expression of the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in the liver and its activity in the plasma.163
        - Experimentally, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia can each promote proteinuria and tubulointerstitial injury,164 while treatment aimed at decreasing lipid levels ameliorates the rate of progression.165 Putative mechanisms of damage include stimulation of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of nitric oxide, modulation of mesangial growth and proliferation, monocyte infiltration,32 and stimulation of growth factor and cytokine release.166- 168
- Hyperphosphatemia (and Hypocalcemia)
    - [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
        - Phosphate retention occurs as soon as GFR begins to decline and the accumulation of phosphate contributes to progression of CKD. Phosphate precipitates with calcium in the interstitium initiating an inflammatory response resulting in interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy [32,33].
- Anaemia
    - [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
        - Anaemia occurs in CKD largely as a result of erythropoietin deficiency. In addition to increasing red cell mass and so tissue oxygen delivery, treatment with erythropoietin appears to have additional benefits of protecting against oxidative stress and tubular cell apoptosis and possibly stimulating angiogenesis. There is some clinical evidence that correcting anaemia slows the progression of CKD [34].
- Hypoxia
    - [ref][YuProgression]
        - Hypoxia has been regarded as a potential cause as well as effect of progression. There is loss of the postglomerular intertubular capillaries in chronic renal failure of various causes.49 Glomerular sclerosis is thought to contribute to this by decreasing downstream tubular blood flow. Expansion of the interstitial space may also diminish capillary perfusion of the tubules.50 The resultant hypoxia favors release of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines. Experimentally, this is associated with increased expression of the antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin 1 and decreased expression of the proangiogenic factor VEGF, which may impair angiogenesis and further propagate the hypoxia.33
- Aldosterone?
    - [ref][RusterProteinuria]
        - The classic understanding of aldosterone as a hormone that is produced in the adrenal cortex, which is involved in the reabsorption of sodium and the secretion of potassium and protons in the collecting duct, needs to be extended.
        - In various animal models of renal diseases, aldosterone is involved in endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, proteinuria, and fibrosis (48).
        - Aldosterone increases the effect of AngII, induces the generation of reactive oxygen species, and leads to an acceleration of the AngII-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (49).



- Extra Stuff
- [ref][MetcalfeProgression]
    - Experimental models suggest that the metabolic acidosis of CKD may also play a role in the progression of disease. As nephron numbers decline each nephron excretes more acid, mainly as ammonium. Hyperammoniagenesis may also result from intratubular catabolism of the excessive protein load associated with proteinuria. The local accumulation of ammonia can directly activate complement leading to secondary tubulointerstitial damage [35,36]. Buffering the acidosis with alkali therapy prevents the increase in ammonium production, and therefore should minimize renal injury. Whilst the renal protective effects of alkali therapy are unproven in clinical practice the prevention of osteopenia and muscle wasting still make such treatment desirable

# Causes and Consequences

- Many causes of CKD exist. However, the most prevalent causes are hypertension, diabetes, glomerular diseases/disorders (such as glomerulonephritis) and urinary tract obstructions.
- Causes
    - Diabetes
    - Glomerular Disease/Disorder
    - Urinary Tract Obstructions

renal fibrosis, which leads to glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, vascular sclerosis, and loss of renal function
http://www.pathophys.org/ckd/

- Causes
    - diabetes â€“ too much glucose in your blood can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys
    - high cholesterol â€“ this can cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels supplying your kidneys, which can make it harder for them to work properly
    - AKI
        - http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/20/6/1199.full#sec-3
    - infection
    - Cancer
        - Kidney cancersâ€¦ (blockage and damage)
        - other cancers that may result in kidney damage...
    - inherited
        - polycystic kidney disease â€“ an inherited condition where growths called cysts develop in the kidneys
    - Urological factors that may reduce eGFR
        - Kidney Stones
        - obstruction/lower urinary tract symptoms (from published QICKD protocol)
        - Obstructive nephropathy is exemplified by bilateral kidney stones and diseases of the prostate.
        - prostate disease (from published QICKD protocol)
        - result of longstanding blockage to the urinary system (such as enlarged prostate or kidney stones)
        - blockages in the flow of urine â€“ for example, from recurrent kidney stones or an enlarged prostate (prostate disease)
    - long-term, regular use of certain medicines â€“ such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
    - Vascular disease includes large vessel disease such as bilateral renal artery stenosis and small vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and vasculitis.
    - Hereditary and congenital
        - Family history (e.g. of stage 5 CKD)
        - e.g. polycystic kidney disease.
    - Nephritis
        - Duno if I should assume that these can cause CKD...they can cause permanent damage so presumably can drop your eGFR low enough and for long enough to count as CKD
        - Pyelonephritis
        - Chronic pylonephritis is a persistent infection of the kidneys â€“ damage can be caused that contributes to CKD and eventual kidney failure.
        - (Tubulo-)Interstitial Nephritis
            - In most cases caused by a drug.
            - Acute will often recover function..either way it is acute not chronic
            - Chronic has no cure
            - I am assuming that chronic (and acute) can cause CKD as the eGFR can drop permanently

- Signs and Symptoms
    - Hypoxia
    - Blood pressure is increased due to fluid overload and production of vasoactive hormones created by the kidney via the renin-angiotensin system, increasing one's risk of developing hypertension and/or suffering from congestive heart failure.
    - Urea accumulates, leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic circulation, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates ("uremic frost").
    - Potassium accumulates in the blood (hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias). Hyperkalemia usually does not develop until the glomerular filtration rate falls to less than 20-25 ml/min/1.73 m2, at which point the kidneys have decreased ability to excrete potassium. Hyperkalemia in CKD can be exacerbated by acidemia (which leads to extracellular shift of potassium) and from lack of insulin.[8]
    - Erythropoietin synthesis is decreased causing anemia.
    - Fluid volume overload symptoms may range from mild edema to life-threatening pulmonary edema.
    - Hyperphosphatemia, due to reduced phosphate excretion, follows the decrease in glomerular filtration. Hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, being a direct stimulus to vascular calcification.[9] Moreover, circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) increase progressively as the renal capacity for phosphate excretion declines, but this adaptative response may also contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased mortality in CKD patients.[10][11]
    - Hypocalcemia, due to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 deficiency (caused by stimulation of FGF-23 and reduction of renal mass),[12] and resistance to the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone.[13] Osteocytes are responsible for the increased production of FGF-23, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3).[14] Later, this progresses to secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function. An extreme consequence is the occurrence of the rare condition named calciphylaxis.[15]
    - Metabolic acidosis (due to accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, uric acid etc.) may cause altered enzyme activity by excess acid acting on enzymes; and also increased excitability of cardiac and neuronal membranes by the promotion of hyperkalemia due to excess acid (acidemia).[17] Acidosis is also due to decreased capacity to generate enough ammonia from the cells of the proximal tubule.[8]
    - Relative Erythropoietin Deficiency
    - Protein in the urine
        - Proteinuria, (Micro/macro)albuminuria, etc.
    - Iron deficiency anemia, which increases in prevalence as kidney function decreases, is especially prevalent in those requiring haemodialysis. It is multifactoral in cause, but includes increased inflammation, reduction in erythropoietin, and hyperuricemia leading to bone marrow suppression.
    - Gout
        - Gout may occur in otherwise healthy people. However, patients with CKD suffer gout more commonly because they often have high levels of uric acid (or urate) in their blood. This is mainly because their kidneys are less effective at removing uric acid from their blood. Patients with CKD may also take medicines (such as water tablets or diuretics) or have other medical conditions (such as high blood pressure) that lead to higher levels of uric acid. The uric acid forms crystals within the patientâ€™s joints. These crystals lead to inflammation and the affected joint becomes hot, red and swollen. Gout can be extremely painful. Any joint may be affected but the big toe is the most common site.
        - Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (BrufenÂ®, Abbott, UK) or diclofenac (VoltarolÂ®, Novartis, UK) are the most common treatment for gout in patients without kidney disease, they should be avoided in patients with CKD. A tablet called colchicine is often used instead. This is a very effective treatment for gout, but some patients find that it causes diarrhoea, in which case it should be stopped. If possible, colchicine tablets should be taken at the very beginning of an attack. A short course of steroids (such as prednisolone tablets) may also be used.
        - Dietitians can help patients reduce the amount of uric acid they ingest in their food. Patients with gout should reduce their consumption of beer, wine, yeasts (for example, MarmiteÂ®), red meats (especially liver) and certain fish (particularly anchovies, herring and mackerel). The drugs used to treat acute attacks of gout will not help to prevent further episodes. If the attacks become frequent, medications to lower the levels of uric acid in the blood might be considered; the most common of which is called allopurinol

    - Renovascular Disease
        - Atherosclerotic Renovascular Disease
        - During the progression of kidney disease, renal function becomes less and less efficient. This can often lead to renal vascular disease â€“ a condition that narrows the blood vessels carrying blood to the kidneys. This is frequently associated with high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney failure

    - scans
        - an ultrasound scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan â€“ to see what the kidneys look like and check whether there are any blockages

- Treatments
    - Lifestyle Changes
        - smoking cessation
        - dietary changes
        - reduce salt intake
        - exercise
        - reduce alcohol consumption
        - lose weight
        - avoiding medicines (e.g. over the counter NSAIDs)
    - Mainly treat other diseases
    - Dialysis
    - Renal Transplant
    - ACE inhibitors
        - [ref][MetcalfeProgression] The kidneys also generate angiotensin II locally, independent of the systemic system, and acting via the angiotensin II type 1 receptor this has significant non-haemodynamic effects contributing to the development of tubulo-interstitial fibrosis by stimulating expression of cytokines and growth factors favouring fibrosis and recruitment of macrophages [26]. Thus, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors performs a dual role, both lowering the glomerular capillary pressure and preventing the increase in pro-fibrotic cytokine expression.
        - ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and limit the progression of deterioration of CKD both by reducing glomerular capillary hypertension and by reducing the mean dimensions of large unselective pores of the glomerular capillary wall so enhancing the size-selective function of this barrier to macromolecules.
    - [ref][AbbateProgression]
        - The renoprotection that was conferred by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the REIN study was mediated by the drugâ€™s action of reducing urinary protein levels, to the extent that patients who were on ramipril had a better outcome paralleled by more reduction in proteinuria, whereas BP was comparable to that of control subjects (3). ACE inhibitorâ€“induced reduction in proteinuria was the strongest time-dependent covariate predicting slower progression to ESRD.
