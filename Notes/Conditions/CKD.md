# Causes and Consequences

- Chronic kidney disease is kidney damage that occurs slowly over many years, often due to diabetes or high blood pressure. Once damaged, the kidneys can’t filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in the body and other problems that can harm a person’s health, including mineral and bone disorder.
